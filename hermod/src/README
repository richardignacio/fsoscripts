Hermod
======

This script listens for FSO API HTTP requests then forwards
them on to elastic search.

PREREQUISITES
    - requires python demjson and flask module

CONFIGURATION
*Edit* hermod.py and change IPADDRESS and PORT to match your
server requirements.

RUNNING
Make sure both run_fsoapi.sh and hermod.py are executable.
As ixoperator, run the following script:

./run_fsoapi.sh



Deploying to remote machine
---------------------------
For automated deployment, use the deploy_fsoapi.sh script from
the source directory.  This automatically copies the scripts
and supporting files to the remote FSO server and runs the
listener as ixoperator.  This works best if the following
criteria are met:

    - key-based authentication to FSO server (as ixoperator)
    - hermod.py dependencies are already met on the FSO server

Usage:
    ./deploy_fsoapi.sh <hostname or ip address of FSO server>
